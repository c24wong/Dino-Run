# Dino-Run
Inspired by the T-Rex Game on Google Chrome

Utilizing Arduino and designed with state machines, as well as an Atari controller, Dino Run is a side scrolling game, in which the player earns points for avoiding obstacles. The game runs until the player comes in contact with an obstacle.

The Atari controller is used for all game functionality, specifically jumping and crouching. The graphics are produced using a 84 x 48 LCD screen and bitmaps. High scores are stored on the EEPROM in the Arduino kit.
